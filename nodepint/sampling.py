## Sampling strategies for the nodepint package

## Sampling can be done sin three ways :
# - woth one radom vector at a time
# - with one random vector at a time to construct a basis
# - with one backpropagated vector at a time
# - with a reduced informative basis determined before hand by the user (using PCA on the ground thruth for instance)
# - with a reduced basis learned simultanuously with the Node (using SINDy for instance)
